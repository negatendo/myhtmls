Who knows though, these days), which proved to me why it's a bad thing that reporters have to write reviews immediately after the performance ends: it got the basic premises right (the concert was amazing, yes), but the language used to describe it made it sound trite and overwrought, full of pathos where there was nuance, etc. It made me sad, because I wish someone could put into words exactly what happened on that stage, but I guess there isn't time for thinking things through when you need to publish asap. (I don't think everything was better before, newswise, but some things were. And I'll stop that thought there.) Also I was annoyed at myself for accidentally deleting the first of these What were you thinking about?-emails, but I did learn that if you use the Mail-app on the iPhone, it will delete emails if you swipe too far left (I only meant to add it to my mailinglist-filter, but instead I deleted it, twice, from both the inbox and the trash can. I was suitably impressed). And now I'm wondering if there really is any point to saying so many words to a stranger, on a mailing list I only recently joined, when I don't know what the purpose of it all is. I think maybe a decade and a half of blogging makes me more likely to not assume ill intent in questions like these, but that's the sort of thought I think I'll let lie (I only slept for four hours last night, because I was on a concert-high and that was a horrible idea, but it's not like I could skip work, so here I am, and I'm not dead yet, but I might fall asleep at my desk). And I hope you have a good weekend! (I listened to Dar Williams on my way to work, on shuffle, and my iPod played the song \"Better Days\" and it is lovely. So many of her songs are lovely. And I've been listening to her again this week because something – I still don't know what – in Taylor Swift's song \"22\" made me think of \"As Cool As I Am\". I don't know if that's the kind of reference you'll get, but if you do, maybe you'll see why they might strike one as similar?
