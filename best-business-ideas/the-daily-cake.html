What's one of the classic scaling issues that an growing business faces? I'll give a clue: it begins to occur once you hire your 336th employee, and it involves cake.

If you guessed employee birthdays you are correct. Math clearly states that with enough hirees, your company will eventually have to celebrate an employee's birthday nearly every day. With cake. If you exclude the weekend-born I'm sure the math says something even more fucked up I dunno.

This might not seem so bad at first, but this simple gesture of inclusion and equality will begin to rot at very hearts of your human resources if not addressed delicately. The complexities and awkwardness brought on by diet restrictions, conflicting tastes, and overlapping birthdays will cause this symbol of ultimate satisfaction - the cake - to too often become devastatingly unsatisfying. Massive amounts of money and time are wasted by business yearly on finding cakes and caring. As a business owner you also know that this feeling of satisfaction is necessary for your workforce's happiness. Unexpectedly, the innocent cake becomes a problem.

It doesn't have to be this way. It may be possible to design a single cake to satisfy all needs. Through a simple web interface, you can correlate your employee birthdays and diet restrictions with options to indicate the size of cake and delivery date. Those who do not wish to eat cake can pre-decline ahead of The Daily Cake. Since it does arrive every day, why not make The Daily Cake more of a benefit to all? Vitamin fortify the cake like they do with Soylent or breakfast cereals. Add whey protein powder and digestive probiotics to keep your employees going strong. Then we can all have cake every day!
