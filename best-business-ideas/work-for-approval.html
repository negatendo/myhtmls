At some point your friends will start doing whatever they can to not hear about your idea any further. They will dismiss any mention of it with a wave of their hand while saying, "Yea man, whatever! Like I said, just go for it!" and other encouraging things.

When this happens, you may feel a bit of heartbreak. Suddenly the business idea won't seem that "best" anymore. You may realize you never really wanted to start a business; you just wanted other people's approval.

When this happens, do whatever you can to see your business idea through, no matter the cost. You don't want to look like an idiot in front of your friends after all.
