Risk is a part of any business venture and your job will be to identify and manage it the best you can.

As you are building your company, consider ways to manage financial risk through non-financial opportunities. Look for ideas within your own customers or products. If you can address risk through the factors that you control then nothing will cut into your earnings. 

As an example, take a look at the highly successful US Health Care industry, who have found ways to manage risk by discarding human lives.
