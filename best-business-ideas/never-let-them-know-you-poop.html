An entrepreneur should know how to recognize failure and move quickly when they do, but what if you fail at recognizing failure? 

Now that I think about it maybe you're doing everything wrong? 

Let's face it, thousands of articles on the Internet and people on Twitter seem to be telling you that every day. It's basically war out there. Doing 30 pushups every morning and then cargo-culting everything you read in The Harvard Business Review seems like the best way to fight back. Your employees will appreciate the attention you give to all those "big important business things" that they couldn't possibly understand when you interrupt their work to tell them about it. (Also make sure you Tweet about those pushups.) 

While we're at it, why the hell are you reading How To Win Friends & Influence People when you should actually be reading The Art of War? What kind of entrepreneur are you anyway? 

Most importantly, never let them know you poop. Never.
