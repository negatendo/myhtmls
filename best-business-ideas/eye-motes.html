We need to understand eye-motes and floaters better. What are their physical properties? How do they get there? How long to they last? 

What we then do is invent a special cannon meant to be fired at large events. This cannon shoots specially formulated eye-mote particles into the air. Hopefully the majority of the attendees get them in their eyes. 

These eye-motes will be shaped like little logos and advertisements, of course.
