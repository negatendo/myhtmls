To find your next idea just walk the same path every day.

You might already be doing this with your commute or daily routine. Good!

The next step is to completely bore yourself with the path. 

You are not allowed to do anything to make traveling the path more interesting. No listening to music or podcasts. No talking to anyone.

If you must focus on anything, focus on the path, and travel it often. 

Every day if you can. 

It will get droll. Become unbearable. It might even seem like torture.

To get wherever you are going. To get home from wherever you went.

Then one day you will notice something. Another path. 

A path you've never seen before.

You'll ask, "Where does this other path go?" "Was it hidden by a bush?" "Was it really always here?"

Yes, it was always there. 

That path is your idea.

Now, I'm not saying it's a good business idea, but you definitely won't be bored anymore!
