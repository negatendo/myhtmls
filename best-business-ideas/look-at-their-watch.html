There's many things to consider when hiring new employees, but I'm going to tell you the one thing to pay attention to the most: their watch.

Note what kind of meaning it might have to them. Is it a nice watch, perhaps above their pay scale? Very good. Is it a crappy old watch, in need of replacement? Also good. If they have no watch be very suspicious.

The reason you want to pay attention to their watch is that it is a symbol of their perspective on work and success. No doubt this person will come to you with a variety of university and college degrees under their belt. This is already a good sign, as it shows they are willing to dedicate years of toil to receiving nothing more than a small and mostly symbolic piece of paper. This is just reward to these people, who have been trained from youth in a schooling in a system that equates hard work to abstract symbols of accomplishment. Ribbons for winning races. Gold stars for well-written papers. Ranking system for grades. Etc.

Today, a watch is nothing more than one of these symbols. It also serves as the perfect comeuppance for people who will spend most of their their life completely exhausting themselves physically and mentally for your company.

When you had this person a nice, expensive watch on their day of retirement it will seem like a grand reward compared to all the papers and stars. Maybe their family will even put it on their corpse after they are dead.
