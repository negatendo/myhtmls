As a businessperson it's important you learn to eat your own dog food. Why not turn this into an exit strategy too?

You can make minor changes to it over time if necessary, but try not to reveal why you're improving the dog food. Save your tasting research for late at night at your desk when everyone else has left for the day. You'll want to try and vitamin fortify the dog food in alignment with your own nutritional needs if possible. Minor improvements to texture and taste are fine, but keep in mind you'll have to constantly convince everyone these changes are for the dogs.

Then when your business finally goes under you can just eat the dog food.
