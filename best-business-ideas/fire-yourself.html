One day you may be delighted to find that your idea has actually shown some promise and grown into a business. When this happens you will proudly call yourself founder.

Then fire yourself, because all founders should fire themselves.

This is because a founder is someone who has successfully been propelled by their own delusion. This is a dangerous state for any human, and despite what you may think, nearly impossible to resist. Once you've received validation that your "original," abstract thought had some kind of real value, you will never see things the same. You will believe in your ideas and you will be in control of a company: a dual toxin for any business that actually wants to succeed.

The pervading symptom of this state of being will show up as a growing ignorance about your environmental conditions. You will become blissfully unaware of the external conditions, work, support, and people that helped develop your ideas and continue to support it. You will also begin to think that not only this but perhaps more of your ideas and thoughts have value based off merit alone. Your merit.

This way of thinking will only cause small problems however. A few failures here and there. It's not until it's time to finally hire some employees that the toxin really takes effect. You see, you will begin to hire key people to fit certain roles, solve certain problems, and develop your "company culture." After all, you understand the idea now, and these are the smart people you've always wanted to bring in to make it happen. I mean look how the boxes line up!

The problem is that when you ask people to check a box all they will ever do is check a box. Hires brought on to fill a role will always only fill that role, spending time and resources defending it even when that's not a good decision. Other employees brought in to solve certain problems will solve them but new ones will not be found in time, and when they occur no one will offer up any ideas. (You're the one with the ideas.)

This isn't to say your delusions will not be challenged. Someday someone may appear and try. They will act out of their space, perhaps even directly confronting you with your delusion. Sadly, when that happens, you'll probably fire this person instead of yourself. "It was never about the work. She just didn't fit our culture."

So the toxin will continue. These will all seem like minor problems at first, but then one fateful day your company will face a real challenge. This challenge will force it to change in big ways. This means you will need to change too, and you probably won't, because why should you? I mean look at how great things are going so far? It's at this point everyone else around you will realize you should have left long ago.

You see, all founders need to fire themselves because a business is actually not a pirate ship to be steered or the goddamn Starship Enterprise. A business is actually a revolting mutant biomass clinging to the edge life inside some kind of perverted economic biodome. To survive it must adapt, expand, and consume whatever it finds in whatever environment it faces. Your idea was a mere seed for this creature, and essentially irrelevant in the long term. 

A successful business must grow, sliming its tendrils long and wide, absorbing all it can, becoming larger and larger and never stopping until it is killed.

Which is kind of gross anyway. I mean why do you even want to be a part of that? Be happy your idea was a small part and then get the fuck out.
