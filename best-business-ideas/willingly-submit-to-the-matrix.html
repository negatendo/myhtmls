People often point the finger at video games and virtual worlds for the development of social problems. What they don't realize is that it's actually the other way around: existing society drives people to video games and virtual worlds.

This ignorance is hint at your moment to capitalize. As more and more of the masses of the earth become disenfranchised with "reality," it is inevitable that many will want to check-out into a virtual world indefinitely. Eventually virtual worlds will seem so appealing compared to our dystopian reality that only the most privileged and wealthy will have the luxury of avoiding them entirely.

This is where you turn this situation into profit, and more specifically, power. That's right: human batteries.

The movie The Matrix already suggested this as a form of enslavement, but what if it's something we will willingly submit ourselves to when the time comes? That's your hedge.
